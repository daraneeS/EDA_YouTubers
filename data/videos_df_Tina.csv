About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

In this video, I go in depth on how to self study online using online courses and how to not give up like a third of the way in. If you have bought online courses and just never actuallly finished them, you are not alone. An average of only 10% of people actually finish an online course. And I was the 90% too before I developed and went through the process that I talk about in this video.

Be warned, this is a thorough discussion that isn't just tips and tricks - it's going to involve some introspection from you as well. I promise it's worth it though.

Self study is hard! It's hard to design an effective and efficient self study plan and I argue even harder to actually stick with it. It's common to fall into the trap of buying other people's study plans and then giving up. Or falling into tutorial hell and giving up. Or feel frustrated because you feel like you're running around in circles and not seeing progress and giving up. Basically, it's really really easy to give up. So in this video, I'm going to share with you guys 8 crucial ingredients that I incorporate into my study plans. The first 5 is for designing the study plan and the last 3 are to make sure that I actually stick with it. 

There you have it: how I design effective study plans and stick with them!

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :) 

I have accepted that I will forever be a lazy person so have since decided to embrace that. My motto is to always minimize effort and maximize outcome!

I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

This is  a 2 hour study with me live :) We'll be doing 50 minute pomodoros with 10 minute break from 7:30am to ~9:30am CST. I'm in dire need of more accountability so really looking forward to firmly establishing a morning learning habit AND I can't wait to chat with you guys during the breaks ❤️

Please note that THIS IS NOT A TAUGHT LESSON. We're just hanging out and motivating each other to be productive c:

Rules:
No discrimination, abuse, self promotion, financial advice, politically controversial comments, or spam allowed. We've also had instances where people were breaking the rules in a language that some mods and I can't read so we could not take action in a timely manner. Because of this, I am also banning extended conversation in any non-english languages. Feel free to have 1 - 2 exchanges though! If you want to have a longer conversation, please do so in the discord. These rules apply to everybody in the stream. 

Note: I'm not one to try to restrict people's freedom of speech so the tolerance that mods and I have is quite high. You can make comments and talk about anything else. However, if you break these rules once, we will delete your messages, time you out, and give you a warning. If you do it again we will permanently ban you indiscriminately. The goal of these streams is to create a safe, productive, and hopefully entertaining study environment where we keep each other accountable as we work towards our goals. 

Examples of things that are okay to say: 
""Why you look so tired"" (I get this every single stream maybe I should actually have a FAQ too lol)
""You suck at data science"" (This is not very constructive but it is an opinion and doesn't violate the rules)
""Data science is gonna be taken over by robots and we're all gonna lose our jobs"" (I don't agree with this but it is an opinion and doesn't violate the rules)

Example of things that are NOT okay: 
""I hate [insert ethnic group]"" (or anything along these lines)
""[insert mod name] you're a piece of poop"" (or anything along these lines)
""pls review my resume"" x 10 (pls don't spam)

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

This is  a 2 hour study with me live :) We'll be doing 50 minute pomodoros with 10 minute break from 7:30am to ~9:30am CST. I'm in dire need of more accountability so really looking forward to firmly establishing a morning learning habit AND I can't wait to chat with you guys during the breaks ❤️

Please note that THIS IS NOT A TAUGHT LESSON. We're just hanging out and motivating each other to be productive c: 

discord: https://discord.gg/5mMAtprshX
livestreaming google calendar: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=cDBtOGgxOG1waW92bTJxYzdpZmkzNmgwODhAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ

Rules:
No discrimination, abuse, self promotion, financial advice, politically controversial comments, or spam allowed. We've also had instances where people were breaking the rules in a language that some mods and I can't read so we could not take action in a timely manner. Because of this, I am also banning extended conversation in any non-english languages. Feel free to have 1 - 2 exchanges though! If you want to have a longer conversation, please do so in the discord. These rules apply to everybody in the stream. 

Note: I'm not one to try to restrict people's freedom of speech so the tolerance that mods and I have is quite high. You can make comments and talk about anything else. However, if you break these rules once, we will delete your messages, time you out, and give you a warning. If you do it again we will permanently ban you indiscriminately. The goal of these streams is to create a safe, productive, and hopefully entertaining study environment where we keep each other accountable as we work towards our goals. 

Examples of things that are okay to say: 
""Why you look so tired"" (I get this every single stream maybe I should actually have a FAQ too lol)
""You suck at data science"" (This is not very constructive but it is an opinion and doesn't violate the rules)
""Data science is gonna be taken over by robots and we're all gonna lose our jobs"" (I don't agree with this but it is an opinion and doesn't violate the rules)

Example of things that are NOT okay: 
""I hate [insert ethnic group]"" (or anything along these lines)
""[insert mod name] you're a piece of poop"" (or anything along these lines)
""pls review my resume"" x 10 (pls don't spam)

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :) 

I have accepted that I will forever be a lazy person so have since decided to embrace that. My motto is to always minimize effort and maximize outcome!

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

In this video, I go in depth on how to self study online using online courses and how to not give up like a third of the way in. If you have bought online courses and just never actuallly finished them, you are not alone. An average of only 10% of people actually finish an online course. And I was the 90% too before I developed and went through the process that I talk about in this video.

Be warned, this is a thorough discussion that isn't just tips and tricks - it's going to involve some introspection from you as well. I promise it's worth it though.

========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

It's of course not always like this but it's also not a rarity. 

I hope you guys enjoy this vlog, where I also document me working on a new nlp project in collab with Ken Jee :) Please let me know if you want to see more vlogs! Suggestions always welcome!

This video is a deep dive into MCIT and goes beyond all the stats you can find already online. Arvind and I talk about real experiences of real students and he gives amazing insights into what MCIT is about and if you are someone that should really dedicate yourself to this program. Arvind is not only the director of MCIT, professor, and my past boss (I was a TA for one of his classes), but also an incredible mentor and human being. He's honest, extremely intelligent, caring, and humble (sorry Arvind I know I'm probably embarrassing you haha). I was worried that this interview-style video is too long, but I decided to do very minimal editing and just post it because I think it's just so valuable. I added timestamps though so please feel free to skip around! I really hope you enjoy it and find it useful :)

I also made a post a few weeks back crowdsourcing questions and I'm pretty proud to say that we got through almost all of them in this video :D

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :) 

I have accepted that I will forever be a lazy person so have since decided to embrace that. My motto is to always minimize effort and maximize outcome!

========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛About me 
========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

136,rd1HKwJT6GM,Upenn MCIT Program Details and Real Student Experiences - Dr. Arvind Bhusnurmath,2020-08-30T22:57:09Z,PT54M36S,3276.0,68,0,277,9630,28,Science & Technology,UC2UXDak6o7rBm23k3Vv5dww,Tina Huang,"Hi everyone, I'm so excited to share this video with anyone that is interested in MCIT at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) or even currently enrolled! This video is a deep dive into MCIT and goes beyond all the stats you can find already online. Arvind and I talk about real experiences of real students and he gives amazing insights into what MCIT is about and if you are someone that should really dedicate yourself to this program. Arvind is not only the director of MCIT, professor, and my past boss (I was a TA for one of his classes), but also an incredible mentor and human being. He's honest, extremely intelligent, caring, and humble (sorry Arvind I know I'm probably embarrassing you haha). I was worried that this interview-style video is too long, but I decided to do very minimal editing and just post it because I think it's just so valuable. I added timestamps though so please feel free to skip around! I really hope you enjoy it and find it useful :)

137,vaD3ZFFNwhM,How to learn SQL for data science interview (the minimize effort maximize outcome way),2020-08-12T15:48:29Z,PT10M27S,627.0,217,0,5068,83352,28,Science & Technology,UC2UXDak6o7rBm23k3Vv5dww,Tina Huang,"This is a step by step guide for how I learned SQL for my FANG data science interview. I had never touched SQL before and only had 2 weeks to prepare for my interview. So I made a scientifically-backed study plan to learn SQL most efficiently with the least amount of time and effort. By the end of the 11 days, I felt super confident and prepared. I went on to pass my FANG data science interviews and got the job! 

My motto: Minimize effort and maximize outcome!!

Btw apologies about audio quality from about 2  - 3.5 min mark. Something weird happened to my mic :(
