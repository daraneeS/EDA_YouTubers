This channel is about data science, learning, and productivity. I love learning new things and my goal is to always minimize effort and maximize outcome! 

I strive to do things the most efficient way possible and with the highest reward. I basically refuse to do extra work to achieve my goals c: 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A little about myself:

I did my undergraduate at the University of Toronto where I studied pharmacology. I was pre-med but decided I would be a terrible doctor üò±. I worked in bioinformatics for a year and then did my masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania. 

I interned at Goldman Sachs, then got my current data science job in tech. 

Talk soon!
