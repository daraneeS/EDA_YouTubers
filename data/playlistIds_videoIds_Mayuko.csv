We have all encountered a high-pressure environment at one point or another. They certainly challenge us to grow out of our comfort zone, but it can also be an unwelcome obstacle that we have to work through in life. My guest today, Will Yu, and I will talk about coping with high-pressure environments and how we worked through them, focusing on growing up into adulthood through school and work.

Will Yu is an Instructor in Physics at Phillips Academy, a private boarding high school in Andover, MA. He studied Biomedical Engineering at Columbia University and will be attending Stanford University in the Fall of 2021 to pursue a Ph.D. in Bioengineering. He is also an avid PC gamer and began streaming on twitch.tv in 2017 for fun. Now, Will uses his experience in education to stream thoughtful conversations around current events and finding success in our academic and personal pursuits. 
https://www.twitch.tv/wyuvern

Muko's Corner is a show about becoming a better version of yourself for your life and your tech career. I'll have guests on the show to share their thoughts and expertise on various topics around navigating a career in technology and leading a life that feels more You, through discussions around mental health, cultural identity, and more.

It's something that's been becoming a bigger theme in my life since starting my Youtube channel, and I honestly love learning more about it. Growing up it might have felt like you had to choose to either be a creative person or a science/logic person like you're either right-brained or left-brained. As I get older, I'm realizing that life is not nearly as binary as I thought. In today's show, we'll talk about this myth with our guest, Matthew Encina, and how we've both found our middle ground.

Matthew Encina is a creative director, designer, and content creator. He makes thoughtful content to share insights and stories from his journey as a creative professional, to help others find their way. Previously, Matthew served as the Chief Content Officer at The Futur, and was an award-winning Creative Director at Blind. Now, he’s on his own, exploring new possibilities, and rediscovering his creative voice.

How did we help each other? Do we have any regrets? And more!

Jarvis Johnson first ventured onto YouTube as a 14 year old, then studied at Georgia Tech. He worked for several years a software engineer at Yelp and Patreon before becoming a professional YouTuber, where his commentary and comedy vlogs about entertainment, consumer tech and the internet have drawn in 1.5 million subscribers. He's tackled a range of subjects--from misinformation content farms to the Disney movies he liked as a kid. Behind a different mic, his ""Sad Boyz"" podcast has dealt with topics such as mental health among teens and young people.

This video was inspired by Wong Fu Production's new series, Yappie! A lot of the experiences and themes in that series were things that I related to and thought about often.
You can watch the series here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSHabwxChOtX1HLAKXle8-w7FvQ5Xg8gD

Also, I hope y'all don't take this as ""I don't like being a Software Engineer"". I very much do enjoy being a Software Engineer and I'm grateful to have found a role in which I _can_ have a positive impact on others, especially in an area I care about - I think that's one of the best things about technology. I'm hoping this video will explain a little bit more about the Why behind a lot of the choices I made early on. 

'Hope you have a great day, wherever you are.
x, mayuko

I'm also hiring for a Creative Assistant! More info: https://hellomayuko.com/jobs

This video was born out of my own frustration of not being productive. I totally own up to titling and branding some of my stuff towards productivity, but i'd be lying if I told you I was this productivity machine; I'm still very much human. Through therapy, I've been able to learn a ton more about myself with regards to how I view my own worth and move through time -- I guess I just wanted to make a video about this, because I kinda didn't really feel like making anything else.

00:00 Intro
03:09 Introducing structure into your workday
03:46 Stick to your usual workday routines
05:11 Get dressed for work
06:10 Find a spot to work from
07:20 It's okay if your WFH day differs from an office day
08:49 Take breaks
10:03 (Over)communicate with your teammates
12:32 Work your usual hours
14:44 Change up your working location
15:15 Move yo' body
16:16 Use a Pomodoro timer
17:07 Outtro

Today I present to you my 10 tips for working from home. I usually work from home at least once a week (before this whole pandemic thing started), just to keep a better work life balance so that I don't have to do all my adult/life/house things on the weekends. It feels a little bit like I've been preparing myself for this whole time actually 😅I took a lot of inspiration from Ingrid Nilsen's video on her tips for working from home (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDgckuEAqLQ), which I learned a lot from when I was first starting to have regular work from home days. If you have any tips of your own, let me know in the comments down below!

I feel very lucky to have a job where I can work from home and not be too impacted job-wise by the pandemic. I know others haven't been so lucky, so I hope that you all are practicing compassion and being there for each other during this time. This too shall pass (so long as we each do what we can to make this thing pass fast) 💖

💛 FUN FUN FUNCTION
Since 2015, Fun Fun Function (FFF) is one of the longest running weekly YouTube shows on programming 🏅 thanks to its consistency and quality reaching 200,000+ developers.

🤦‍♂️ The Failing Together concept is what makes FFF unique. Most coding content out there focus on step-by-step tutorials. We think tutorials are too far removed from what everyday development is like. Instead, FFF has created a completely new learning environment where we grow from failure, by solving problems while intensively interacting with a live audience. 

Tutorials try to solve a problem. Failing Together makes you grow as a developer and coworker.

📹 Each show is recorded live on Twitch in a 2-hour livestream on Mondays. The host, assisted by the audience, is tasked to complete a programming challenge by an expert guest. Like in the real world, we often fail, and learn from it. This, of course, reflects what the audience identifies with, and is one of the most praised aspects of the show. 

⏯ On Fridays, an edited version of the show is adapted for and published on YouTube. 

Content Topics revolve around: JavaScript, Functional Programming, Software Architecture, Quality Processes, Developer Career and Health, Team Collaboration, Software Development, Project Management",2019-09-19T22:00:12Z

And while this is the least of anyone's problems right now in the world, I also wanted to come clean so that I can move forward in life.

I'm actually really excited for what's to come next in life, and feel more motivated and genuinely me than I have in a while. It's been 2 months since I've left, and I can confidently say that I made the right decision. 

I'm going to continue making lots of content about tech and Software Engineering because even though I'm not working full time as one anymore, it's still close to my heart and it'll always be a part of me. I still strongly believe in wanting to make content that helps people enter the industry and talk about things honestly, openly, and productively, so expect lots of content coming your way about all of this and more! And I sincerely hope you'll come along with me on the journey.

It's been a long time since I did a vlog! Here's a look at my day from yesterday (Saturday). I did a similar style as my day in the life of a software engineering video (which has BLOWN UP! I love seeing everyone's versions of it 😁). I'm looking forward to making more vlogs for y'all, let me know if you like seeing these!

and now for some announcements:

The MARCH LIVESTREAM will be on Saturday, March 3rd at 6PM PST! Hopefully alternating between Saturday nights and Sunday mornings will allow those who couldn't make it last time to join! Hope to see you there.

In other news, I'm almost at 100K subscribers!!! O_O I can't believe it! Thank you all for watching and subscribing and commenting and sharing. Here's to the next 100K! 

Hope you have a great day, wherever you are.
x, mayuko
